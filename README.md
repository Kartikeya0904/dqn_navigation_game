Navigation Game
Navigation is a crucial problem in the field of
artificial intelligence (ai), particularly when
creating autonomous agents that need to navigate
through dynamic or intricate environments. In the
last ten years, reinforcement learning (rl) has
gained significant traction as a powerful method for
enabling agents to learn effective decision-making
strategies through repeated trial-and-error
interactions. Among the different rl techniques,
deep q-learning (DQN) has demonstrated
exceptional performance in tasks that demand
spatial awareness, memory of past actions, and
reward optimization.
This paper presents a navigation game that utilizes
a grid-based structure, employing the DQN
algorithm to guide an agent through a
predetermined environment. The agent's objective
is to travel from a designated starting point to a
predetermined goal state while skillfully evading
static obstacles. The agent is not given any
information about the surroundings and must
discover the best routes, improve its strategy, and
refine its policy over several episodes. Unlike the
random or unpredictable goal placements
commonly seen in academic benchmarks, this
implementation maintains a consistent layout,
resembling real-world scenarios where landmarks
and hazards remain relatively stable.
